With Elon Musk tweeting about every crypto-currency in existence, you need a reliable DEX Provider to help you jump on the wagon and make some quick bucks.

 1inch-compare in an intelligent bot, which tracks transactions on [UNISWAP](https://uniswap.org/) and other DEX Providers and tell how much users could have saved if they had used [1inch Exchange](https://1inch.exchange/) instead.

It tracks transactions at intervals of 5 mins completed over various DEX's and tweets the amount that the user would have saved if he/she had done the same transaction via the [1inch.exchange](https://1inch.exchange/)
